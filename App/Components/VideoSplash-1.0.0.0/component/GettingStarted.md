##  Using VideoViewController

The easiest way to make use of `VideoViewController` is by simply 
specifying a URL to a video:

    {
        public override void ViewDidLoad()
        {
            base.ViewDidLoad();
        
            var bundle = NSBundle.MainBundle;
            var resource = bundle.PathForResource("splash", "mp4");
            
            // set the video
            VideoUrl = new NSUrl(resource, false);
            
            // optionally crop the video
            StartTime = 12.0f;
            Duration = 4.0f;
            
            // make the video translucent
            Alpha = 0.7f;
        }
    }
